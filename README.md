How to Use
When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter your personal details, such as your first and last name, bank ID, user ID, and the amount you want to deposit. Once you have entered your details, you will be asked whether you want to deposit or withdraw funds. If you choose to deposit funds, you will be asked to enter the amount you want to deposit. If you choose to withdraw funds, you will be asked to enter the amount you want to withdraw.

After you have deposited or withdrawn funds, the program will display your updated account information, including your current balance.
